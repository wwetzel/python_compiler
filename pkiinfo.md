##The Peter Kiewit Institute is shaped by the dynamic alliance of education and industry. The Institute's mission is to fuel collaborations and fire the imagination of faculty, students and business alike. In so doing, the Institute offers exceptional career opportunities for students and provides the business community with a growing labor pool of skilled professionals.

##In this collaboration, traditional boundaries do not exist. The University of Nebraska at Omaha's College of Information Science and Technology (IS&T) and the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln's College of Engineering remain separate entities offering a variety of degrees while they work closely together inviting students to explore courses and labs in both colleges. The end result, for example, is a computer science student who not only understands the issues of data collection, data mining and systems architecture but has a working knowledge of hardware requirements necessary to ensure efficiency and connectivity of purpose.
